# `@deepseek-ai/dsh-bid`

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

Workspace-local intake and shared bid control-plane types for the bid-writing profile. `BidWorkspace` saves supported PDF, DOCX, DOC, XLSX, XLS, TXT, and Markdown files below `.bid-harness/sessions/<session>/`. Every imported file receives `corpus/<stored-name>/document.md`; PDF, DOCX, and DOC additionally receive `structure.json` and `metadata.json` from `extractDocument()`. Manifest version 3 records the corpus and artifact paths. The caller persists `messageInventory()` with the user's request, so the agent sees workspace-relative source, document, chunk, and structure paths and can use its normal `grep` and `read` tools.

PDF, DOCX, and DOC share one parser entry:

```ts
import { extractDocument } from '@deepseek-ai/dsh-bid'

await extractDocument({
  sourcePath: './workspace/input/招标文件.pdf',
  outputDir: './workspace/corpus/招标文件.pdf',
})
```

PDF extraction uses text positions to retain physical lines and emits `<!-- page: N -->` comments. Text-free PDFs write their corpus with `needs_ocr`; this package does not run OCR. DOCX extraction retains Word headings, lists, and tables without inventing page numbers. DOC extraction uses the pure-JavaScript `word-extractor` parser, so Windows, macOS, and Linux require no Word, LibreOffice, `antiword`, or other system executable. DOC text retains paragraphs and tab-separated table cells, but the binary format does not expose dependable Markdown heading levels or page numbers through this parser.

Import rejects empty, unsafe, unsupported, oversized, and over-count uploads. A parse failure retains the original file and records the stable extraction error in `manifest.json`. Reusing an extraction output directory atomically replaces the three complete corpus files through `dsh-atomic-write`. `exportDocx()` accepts only session-local Markdown and writes under the session output directory.

## Control plane types

The package exports the fixed `BidStage` and `StageRunStatus` values plus `BidRuntimeState`, `BidStagePolicy`, `BidStageTask`, `StageArtifact`, and `StageValidationResult`. The browser-safe `@deepseek-ai/dsh-bid/control-plane` subpath additionally exports `BidClientProjection`, the `BidUploadFile` request and `BidFileIntakeResult` response, its Host-admitted action list, and composer capability without loading document parsers or Node modules. `BID_STAGES` and `STAGE_RUN_STATUSES` are the runtime enumerations for validators and clients; their derived union types prevent a second stage or status vocabulary.

The five `bid.*` records declaration-merge into the existing `@deepseek-ai/dsh-session` `SessionEventMap` and remain log-only. They record stage transitions, workspace artifact references, failure reasons, and user confirmations without storing document or generated-content bodies.

## Control plane runtime

`BidOrchestrator` binds one DSH Session and restores state from `Session.events` through the sole `reduceBidRuntimeState()` reducer. `runCurrentProgramStage()` executes the pending or failed program-owned stage once. `drive()` follows each current `StagePolicy` while the Executor reports `canExecute(stage)`, and stops at user input, an unsupported pending stage, failure, or final completion. Fresh file intake waits for the dedicated upload action because its executor requires the admitted file batch. `retry()`, `confirm()`, `admitAction()`, and `admitPrompt()` enforce state and permissions on the Host.

`registerBidRuntimeProjection()` registers the same reducer as the `bid.runtime` DSH Session Projection. Its `BidClientProjection` exposes only Host-admitted actions, composer capability, and the Host-configured `allowedExtensions`, `maxFiles`, `maxFileBytes`, and `maxTotalBytes` limits. The Host plugin registers this projection and globally rejects generic prompt admission for sessions whose resolved preset is `bid`.

The generated `bid/uploadFiles` Remote resolves the live Session and uses only its Host-resolved preset and `header.cwd`. It admits the complete browser batch under a per-Session lock, decodes canonical base64 after checking declared limits, imports through `BidWorkspace`, validates the resulting `manifest.json`, input, corpus, chunk index, and chunks, then calls `drive()`. The Host also calls `drive()` on `agent/session-start`, so creation and resume use the same log-derived continuation. The production Executor supports Tender Analysis and Evidence Mapping; successful S3 validation stops at `outline_generation/pending`.

The package provides the file-intake program Executor and Validator plus Tender Analysis and Evidence Mapping execution and validation. S3 reads S2 Artifacts and the manifest, uses the normal Agent `grep` then `read` loop to select local reference chunks, and writes `analysis/evidence-map.json`. Each Requirement and Scoring mapping is covered exactly once; materials identify an indexed local chunk, inclusive lines, a `reuse`, `adapt`, `reference`, or `background` use, and a summary. A mapping may have no materials when `missing_topics` records the unresolved technical writing need. The Validator verifies S2 coverage and every material's manifest file, indexed chunk, linked-path safety, and line range before the Host advances the stage. Web research is not implemented.

## Model Experience

### Inventory text

#### What the model sees

The caller persists `messageInventory()` as a user message containing each file's name, workspace-relative source, parsed-document and structure paths, and parse status. Document bytes and absolute host paths never enter this text. The paths let the model use the existing `grep` and `read` tools.

#### Token effect

The bounded inventory adds one fixed set of lines per imported file. Extracted document text enters context only when the model reads it.

#### KV Cache effect

The persisted inventory is append-only conversation content. Importing files in a later user message does not change the earlier request prefix.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

- PDF extraction does not perform OCR or full table reconstruction; positioned rows remain separate when columns cannot be recovered safely.
- DOC extraction preserves text, paragraph breaks, list markers, and tab-separated table cells but not all binary Word styling.
- DOCX and DOC page fields remain `null` because their source structures do not provide dependable pagination.
- DOCX export supports headings, paragraphs, lists, and tables; it does not apply a company Word template.
